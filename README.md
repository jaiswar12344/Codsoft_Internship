During your internship at CodSoft, you worked on various real-world projects, including credit card, Titanic, and advertising data. You applied a wide range of machine learning techniques and workflows, showcasing your expertise in data processing and model development. Key aspects of your work included:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): You performed in-depth EDA to uncover trends, patterns, and anomalies within datasets, leading to actionable insights and optimized model performance.

ETL (Extract, Transform, Load): You automated the ETL processes to handle large datasets, ensuring smooth data pipelines from raw data extraction to transformation into suitable formats for model building.

Feature Engineering: You designed effective features that enhanced the performance of your models, including handling missing data, feature scaling, encoding categorical variables, and more.

Data Pipelines: You set up and optimized machine learning pipelines to streamline model development, including data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

Modeling and Hyperparameter Tuning: You applied various machine learning algorithms, including regression, classification, and ensemble models, while fine-tuning hyperparameters to improve model accuracy and robustness.

Cross-Validation: You employed cross-validation techniques to ensure model generalizability and prevent overfitting.

Advanced Technologies: You utilized tools and libraries such as Scikit-learn, Pandas, Numpy, and visualization libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn to generate visual insights and validate model outcomes.
